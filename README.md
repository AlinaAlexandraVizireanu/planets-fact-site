## My process

I started this project by checking the design on the Figma file, then I created the website's structure with HTML and then used CSS to implement the style. The logic part of the application was built with JavaScript where I made an HTTP request using AXIOS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Axios

### What I learned

In the process of building this project, I've used mostly Flexbox for positioning which helped me to deepen my knowledge regarding positioning with Flexbox.
While I was implementing the logic part I also deepened my JavaScript skills and I also improved my skills working with Axios.
